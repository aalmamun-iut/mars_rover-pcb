FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE EUROPEAN ROVER CHALLENGE IN 2018 AND 2019 HELD IN POLAND
--------------------------------

Every year more than 50 teams from over 20 different countries participate in a robotics competition known as European Rover Challenge. This event attracts more than 70,000 visitors. The Mars Rover team IUT Avijatrik from Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh, participated in the competition in the year 2018 and 2019 and was the best national team, best in South Asia and ranked 14th and 15th respectively in the world out of 65 teams. I had the honor and privilege to lead a team of more than 30 members as the Head of Electrical System for two years under the mentorship and supervision of professors from my department.
	
During this time, I learnt from facing real world challenges of scale and complexity but it was also the time when I realized my passion and fascination for Embedded and Real-Time systems. I would not be exaggerating a bit if I say there were times, when it felt like I was working on a real rover for NASA Jet Propulsion Lab. Here, I had to manage up to 14 motor drivers of varying voltage and current requirement, design and interface between the STM32 based control system and Arduino based driver system. Given the drivers were expensive and prone to failure compounded with the problem of severe budget constraint, this was also an opportunity to utilize my intuitive problem-solving side to device novel solution of designing a multiplexing system for motor drivers based on relay-switches which was able to operate several motors and actuator using a single driver with built in redundancy. My key responsibilities consisted of but not limited to:

	Designing of the power & load distribution system, remote power monitoring system, rover drive and robotic arm driver module, multiplexing module, emergency system.

	Creating custom PCB packages in Proteus for parts and modules that are not available in the existing library. 

	Interfacing between single board computer (Raspberry Pi) and microcontroller-based development boards (STM32, ESP8266 and Arduino). 

	Coordinate with the programming team to facilitate interfacing between the electrical hardware and rover software.

	Testing, Debugging and Prototyping of designed system 

	Implementation of the PCBs and assembly the complete electrical setup.
